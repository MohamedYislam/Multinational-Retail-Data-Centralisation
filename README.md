### 3. Months with the largest sales

**Objective:**
Identifying which months have produced the most sales.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    dates.month,
    ROUND(SUM((products."product_price(Â£)" * orders.product_quantity)::numeric), 2) AS total_sales
FROM
    orders_table orders
JOIN
    dim_date_times dates ON orders.date_uuid = dates.date_uuid
JOIN
    dim_products products ON orders.product_code = products.product_code
GROUP BY
    dates.month
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

This query calculates the total sales for each month by joining the `orders_table`, `dim_date_times`, and `dim_products` tables. The product price is multiplied by the quantity sold to get the total sales. By grouping the results by month and summing the sales, we can identify which months have the highest sales.
We use `::numeric` to ensure precise arithmetic operations and `ROUND` to format the total sales to two decimal places.

**Result:**

### 5. Percentage of Sales by Store Type

**Objective:**
We need to determine the total and percentage of sales coming from each of the different store types to identify which store type generates the most revenue.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH orders_store_products_cte AS (
    SELECT 
        s.store_type,
        (o.product_quantity * p."product_price(Â£)")::numeric AS amount_paid
    FROM
        orders_table o
    JOIN
        dim_products p ON p.product_code = o.product_code
    JOIN
        dim_store_details s ON s.store_code = o.store_code
)
SELECT 
    store_type,
    ROUND(SUM(amount_paid), 2) AS total_sales,
    ROUND((SUM(amount_paid) / SUM(SUM(amount_paid)) OVER ()) * 100, 2) AS percentage_total
FROM 
    orders_store_products_cte
GROUP BY 
    store_type
ORDER BY 
    percentage_total DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), this query first calculates the total sales amount for each store type by joining `orders_table`, `dim_products`, and `dim_store_details`. The CTE simplifies the subsequent query, which calculates the percentage of total sales for each store type.

This query uses Common Table Expression (CTE), orders_store_products_cte, to calculate the total sales amount (amount_paid) for each store type. The CTE joins three tables:

- `orders_table` (order details, including product_quantity and product_code),
- `dim_products` (product prices, joined on product_code),
- `dim_store_details` (store types, joined on store_code).

By joining these tables, we link each order to its product price and store type. The amount_paid is calculated by multiplying product_quantity by product_price(Â£), cast to numeric for precision.

The main query then aggregates amount_paid by store_type and calculates the percentage of total sales using the `OVER ()` clause. This clause computes the overall sum of amount_paid across all store types, allowing us to determine each store type's sales percentage.
The results are rounded to two decimal places to reflect currency format, ensuring clarity in financial reporting.

**Result:**

**Evaluate Super Stores and Malls:**

- Assess the performance of Super Stores and Mall Kiosks to determine their profitability.
- Consider whether consolidating or optimizing these store types could improve overall efficiency and profitability.


### 6. Months with the Highest Sales by Year

**Objective:**
Identifying which months have historically have had the highest sales

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH highest_selling_month_cte AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (d.month)
        SUM(ROUND((p."product_price(Â£)" * o.product_quantity)::numeric, 2)) AS total_sales,
        d.year,
        d.month
    FROM
        orders_table o
    JOIN
        dim_products p ON p.product_code = o.product_code
    JOIN
        dim_date_times d ON d.date_uuid = o.date_uuid
    GROUP BY
        d.year,
        d.month
    ORDER BY
        d.month DESC,
        total_sales DESC
)
SELECT * 
FROM 
    highest_selling_month_cte
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC;
```

**Explanation:**


Here we uses a Common Table Expression find the highest selling month for each month across all years. It calculates the total sales for each month and year combination by joining three tables:

- `orders_table` (order details, including product_quantity and date_uuid)
- `dim_products` (product prices, joined on product_code)
- `dim_date_times` (date information, joined on date_uuid)

The total sales for each month and year are calculated by multiplying the product price `p."product_price(Â£)"` by the product quantity `o.product_quantity`, casting the result to numeric for precision, and rounding to two decimal places using `ROUND()`. The `SUM()` function is then used to aggregate the total sales for each month and year combination.

The `DISTINCT ON (d.month)` clause is used to select only the first row for each distinct month value. This is combined with the `ORDER BY` clause inside the CTE, which sorts the results by month in descending order and then by total sales in descending order. 
This ensures that for each month, we get the year with the highest total sales.
Finally, the main query selects all columns from the `highest_selling_month_cte` and orders the results by `total_sales` in descending order, giving us the highest selling month across all years at the top of the result set.

**Result:**

    country_code 
FROM 
    dim_store_details 
GROUP BY 
    country_code 
ORDER BY 
    total_staff_number DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

We calculate the total number of staff for each country by summing the `staff_numbers` from the `dim_store_details` table. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by `country_code`, while the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the total staff number in descending order.

**Result:**

### 8. Top-Selling Store Types in Germany

**Objective:**
Which type of store generates the most sales in Germany, so we can make informed decision regarding business expansions.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(ROUND((o.product_quantity * p."product_price(Â£)")::numeric, 2)) AS total_sales,
    s.store_type,
    s.country_code
FROM
    orders_table o
JOIN
    dim_products p ON p.product_code = o.product_code
JOIN
    dim_store_details s ON s.store_code = o.store_code
WHERE
    s.country_code = 'DE'
GROUP BY
    s.store_type,
    s.country_code
ORDER BY
    total_sales ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

This query calculates the total sales for each store type in Germany (country_code 'DE'). 

It joins three tables to connect the necessary data:

- `orders_table` (order details, including product_quantity and product_code)
- `dim_products` (product prices, joined on product_code to calculate total sales)
- `dim_store_details` (store types and country codes, joined on store_code to filter by country)

The total sales are calculated by multiplying the product quantity `o.product_quantity` by the product price `p."product_price(Â£)"`, casting the result to numeric for precision, and rounding to two decimal places using `ROUND()`. 

The `SUM()` function aggregates the total sales for each store type within Germany.
The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only stores in Germany. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by store type and country code, while the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by total sales in ascending order.

This query efficiently combines data from multiple tables to provide meaningful insights into store performance within a specific country.

**Result:**

### 9. Average Time Between Sales by Year

**Objective:**
Calculating how quickly the company is making sales

**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH next_time_stamp_cte AS (
    SELECT
        d.timestamp AS current_timestamp,
        d.year,
        (LEAD(d.timestamp) OVER (ORDER BY d.timestamp)) - d.timestamp AS time_until_next_transaction
    FROM 
        dim_date_times d
)
SELECT 
    year,
    CONCAT(
        '"hours": ', EXTRACT(HOUR FROM AVG(time_until_next_transaction)), ', ',
        '"minutes": ', EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM AVG(time_until_next_transaction)), ', ',
        '"seconds": ', EXTRACT(SECOND FROM AVG(time_until_next_transaction)), ', ',
        '"milliseconds": ', EXTRACT(MILLISECOND FROM AVG(time_until_next_transaction))
    ) AS actual_time_taken
FROM
    next_time_stamp_cte
GROUP BY
    year
ORDER BY
    AVG(time_until_next_transaction) DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

This query calculates the average time between consecutive transactions for each year. 
It uses a Common Table Expression named `next_time_stamp_cte` to determine the time difference between each transaction and the following one.

The `LEAD()` window function is used to access the timestamp of the next transaction. It looks ahead to the next row within the partition (ordered by timestamp) and returns the value of the specified column.  By subtracting the current timestamp from the next one, we obtain the time until the next transaction.

The main query then aggregates the data by year and calculates the average time between transactions using `AVG()`. The `EXTRACT()` function is used to extract the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from the average time interval. The results are concatenated into a single string using `CONCAT()` for readability.

Finally, the results are ordered by the average time between transactions in descending order, showing the years with the longest average time between transactions first.

This query combines advanced SQL techniques, such as using CTEs, window functions `LEAD()`, and date/time functions `EXTRACT()` to to perform complex calculations and data transformations to gain insights into transaction patterns over time.

**Result:**
